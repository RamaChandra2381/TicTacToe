# Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe Game Web Application using HTML 

This repository contains the source code for a simple and interactive HTML-based Tic Tac Toe game. The game is designed for two players as well as player vs. computer, with each taking turns placing their marks (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first to receive three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

IÂ also included the number of rounds they played and how many rounds they won.
